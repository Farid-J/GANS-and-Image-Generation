# Theory and Implementation of DCGAN 
This project is a PyTorch implementation of a deep convolutional generative adversarial neural network machine learning model. The model is trained off of the Oxford 102 Flowers [dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/), using 150 epoches, a learning rate of 0.0002, beta values of 0.5 and 0.999, and generates 64x64 pixel images of flowers.
